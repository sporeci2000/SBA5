This project is a simple blog application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users create, view, edit, and delete blog posts  - everything is saved directly in the browser using localStorage.

Description:
This blog allows users to:
- Write a new blog post with a title and content.
- View a list of all blog posts on the page.
- Edit or delete any post.
- All posts are automatically saved in your browser, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

Building this blog project helped me practice working with the DOM, event listeners, and localStorage in JavaScript. One of the trickiest parts was getting the "Edit" button to work correctlyâ€”specifically, making sure it filled the form with the right post details so they could be updated. It took some experimenting, but I figured it out by tracking which post was being edited and updating it properly when the form was submitted. Overall, this project gave me more confidence in my JavaScript skills and taught me how to break down a task into manageable parts.
